# Fixed Issues

## Issue: Redirect Loop on Login

### Problem
You were seeing `?redirect=%2F` in the URL when trying to login, even though login was successful (you saw the success toast).

### Root Cause
The middleware was trying to check authentication by looking for tokens in cookies or headers, but your app stores tokens in `localStorage`. Since middleware runs on the **server/edge** (not in the browser), it **cannot access localStorage**.

This caused:
1. User tries to login
2. Login succeeds, token stored in localStorage
3. Middleware runs on next request
4. Middleware can't see token (because it's in localStorage)
5. Middleware thinks user is not authenticated
6. Middleware redirects to login with `?redirect=/`

### Solution
**Disabled the middleware** because it's incompatible with localStorage-based authentication.

Route protection is now handled **client-side only** using the `<ProtectedRoute>` component.

## How Authentication Works Now

### Login Flow (Working)
```
1. User submits login form
   ‚Üì
2. API call to your backend
   ‚Üì
3. Backend returns tokens + user with role_id
   ‚Üì
4. Tokens stored in localStorage
   ‚Üì
5. Zustand store updated with user data
   ‚Üì
6. User redirected to dashboard
   ‚Üì
7. <ProtectedRoute> component checks localStorage (client-side)
   ‚Üì
8. If token exists, show content
   ‚Üì
9. If no token, redirect to login
```

### Route Protection (Client-Side)
```typescript
// Wrap your pages with ProtectedRoute
export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <div>Protected content</div>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  );
}
```

The `<ProtectedRoute>` component:
- Runs in the browser (can access localStorage)
- Checks for authToken in localStorage
- Redirects to login if not found
- Shows loading state while checking

## Why Middleware Doesn't Work

### Middleware Limitations
```typescript
// ‚ùå This doesn't work in middleware
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken'); // ‚ùå localStorage is not defined
  // Middleware runs on server/edge, not in browser
}
```

### What Middleware CAN Access
- ‚úÖ Cookies (via `request.cookies`)
- ‚úÖ Headers (via `request.headers`)
- ‚ùå localStorage (browser-only)
- ‚ùå sessionStorage (browser-only)

---

## Alternative: Cookie-Based Auth (Optional)

If you want middleware-level protection, you need to store tokens in **httpOnly cookies** instead of localStorage.

### Changes Required

**1. Backend Changes**
Your backend would need to:
- Set tokens as httpOnly cookies instead of returning them in response body
- Include cookies in all API responses

**2. Frontend Changes**
```typescript
// Instead of:
localStorage.setItem('authToken', token);

// Tokens would be automatically stored in cookies by the browser
// No manual storage needed
```

**3. Middleware Would Work**
```typescript
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const token = request.cookies.get('authToken')?.value;

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/auth/login', request.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

### Pros & Cons

#### localStorage (Current)
‚úÖ Simple to implement
‚úÖ Works with any backend
‚úÖ Easy to read/write in client
‚ùå Vulnerable to XSS attacks
‚ùå Can't use middleware protection
‚ùå Needs manual token management

#### httpOnly Cookies
‚úÖ Secure (protected from XSS)
‚úÖ Can use middleware protection
‚úÖ Automatic token handling
‚ùå Requires backend changes
‚ùå More complex to implement
‚ùå CORS considerations

---

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- ‚úÖ Login with your existing backend API
- ‚úÖ Tokens stored in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Zustand store updated with user data
- ‚úÖ Client-side route protection with `<ProtectedRoute>`
- ‚úÖ Permission checking with `<Can>` component
- ‚úÖ Sidebar filtering based on role
- ‚úÖ State persists across page refresh

### üîß What's Disabled
- üîß Server-side middleware protection (incompatible with localStorage)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What You Need
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Your backend must return `role_id` in user object

## How to Use Route Protection

### Method 1: ProtectedRoute Component (Recommended)

```typescript
// app/(protected)/my-page/page.tsx
import { ProtectedRoute } from "@/components/auth";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <div>This content requires authentication</div>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  );
}
```

### Method 2: useEffect Hook

```typescript
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { useAuthStore } from "@/lib/stores/auth-store";

export default function MyPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const isAuthenticated = useAuthStore((state) => state.isAuthenticated);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      router.push("/auth/login");
    }
  }, [isAuthenticated, router]);

  if (!isAuthenticated) return null;

  return <div>Protected content</div>;
}
```

### Method 3: Layout-Level Protection

```typescript
// app/(protected)/layout.tsx
import { ProtectedRoute } from "@/components/auth";

export default function ProtectedLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <ProtectedRoute>
      {children}
    </ProtectedRoute>
  );
}
```

Now all pages under `(protected)` are automatically protected.

## Testing

### 1. Test Login
```bash
1. Go to /auth/login
2. Enter credentials
3. Should redirect to / (no ?redirect=%2F in URL)
4. Should see success toast
```

### 2. Test Route Protection
```bash
1. Logout
2. Try to access /supervisors
3. Should redirect to /auth/login (via <ProtectedRoute>, not middleware)
4. Login again
5. Should see /supervisors page
```

### 3. Verify No Redirect Loop
```bash
1. Login successfully
2. Check URL - should be clean: http://localhost:3000/
3. No ?redirect=%2F parameter
4. No console errors
```

---

## Summary

**Problem**: Middleware can't access localStorage
**Solution**: Disabled middleware, using client-side protection instead
**Status**: ‚úÖ Working correctly now

You can login normally without the redirect loop issue. Route protection works via the `<ProtectedRoute>` component instead of middleware.
